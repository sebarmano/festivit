# festivit

We at festivit believe in collaboration and charity. 
Our platform automates complex festival logistics for nonprofits so more time can be spent on the important stuff.

In this first release, festivit main objective was to solve 4 specific pain
point of the Shakori Hills festival organization: outdated application
processes, slow application review, data stored in multiple locations and paper
based event check-in.

## About the code
festivit was born as the final project for TIY course in Durham, in August 2014.
The app was created in Ruby on Rails framework, and also Bourbon, Neat,
Javascript among other technologies were used.

## Installation and usage

This application uses Postgres, so you will need it installed on your machine.
If on Linux, use your package manager.
On OS X, if you have Homebrew, run `brew install postgresql`.

Once you have Postgres installed, edit `config/database.yml` -- or set up
Postgres to have a database called 
`freeshelf_development` for your current user.

Next, install all required gems:

```sh
bundle install
```

Finally, set up the database:

```sh
rake db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
